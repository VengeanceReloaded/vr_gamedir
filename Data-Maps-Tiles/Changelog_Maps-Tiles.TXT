Improved Vengeance + UB tilesets (#50-59) // hybrid file for Vengeance-1.13 Reloaded by Hawkeye!

Update: 'Oil Rig' tileset (number 50)

@ Hawk: "Many thanks for your great (art)work man!" :-)


11.05.2011

-(re-)imported original P12, P13, O12 and edited N12 map from vanilla Vengeance Mod 

TO DO: these maps have to be checked regarding tileset-glitches!


16.09.2011

-extracted and imported original password protected "Extras" maps: l14, l15, h14 and i14 (located in the \Extras\MLRS and \Extras\Scud folder) from vanilla Vengeance Mod; 
as suggested by German alphatester Fan for better playability

TO DO: have to be checked concerning potential glitches with the new tilesets as well!


22.09.2011 - New_Tilesets_for_Vengeance-1.13_alphaV2

-copied all remaining Vengeance maps to the maps folder (not just the edited maps by Hawkeye!); 
so it is possible to use and edit all Vengeance maps and tilesets separately with a current v1.13 build (for example with the 4552 release!) and a new Map-Editor without installing the complete Vengeance-1.13 Mod before
-made all existing Vengeance radarmaps and the improved B_MAP.PCX by Kazuya to a part of this file
