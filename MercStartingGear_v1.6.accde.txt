MERCSTARTINGGEAR EDITOR FOR VENGEANCE:RELOADED (and other mods)

1)  Rename the file MercStartingGear_v1.6.accde.RENAME to MercStartingGear_v1.6.accde
2)  Install AccessRuntime.exe (32-bit) if you don't have MS Access installed (link below)
3) 'Import XML-files' to catch any changes to items
4) 'Import MercStartingGear' so you are working with the latest version
5) 'Export MercStartingGear' writes a new MercStartingGear.xml to the gamedir

Things to remember:

-  All your changes are kept in the file MercStartingGear_v1.6.accde
-  Do not upload MercStartingGear_v1.6.accde to SVN
-  Commit changes to SVN early ('Export MercStartingGear' and commit)
-  Update from SVN and 'Import MercStartingGear' regularly

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

MercStartingGear_v1.6.accde is a small Access application for creating multiple gearkits (NSGI), which has been updated for current releases of JA2 1.13 (stable 7435, unstable 7991).

You can only view three kits side-by-side, but all five kits are configurable. Naming the gearkits and setting an absolute price is now supported.

It's available for download in case anyone else is interested, at least until the xml editor is brought up-to-date.

Should works with any NSGI-compatible mod. Confirmed to work with 
 - 1.13 release 7435 (stable)
 - 1.13 release 7991 (unstable)

If you don't have MS Access installed, you will need to download the free Access 2010 Runtime from http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=10910. (AccessRuntime.exe, the 32-bit version)
