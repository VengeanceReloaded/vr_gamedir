"Playable Characters Mod" (PCM) for Vengeance-1.13 Reloaded (English Test-File composed by Scheinworld 23.04.13)


Original idea and concept by Smilingassassin aka "The_Scorpion"



Features:

Converted the non-playable JA2 characters: Perko, Maria, Skyrider, Fred, John, Matt, Oswald, Calvin and Carl into playable characters.


All new playable characters have faces, speech and battle sounds. They also have character skills and their personal equipment. All of them are free.
Changes are very nonintrusive to keep the integrity of the vanilla story, setting, maps etc. intact.



Notes:

Skyrider has his speech limited due to an overlapping issue from his function as a pilot. 
If the player prefers to have Skyrider as the pilot only (same as in the vanilla game), 
then you need to react quickly. After Skyrider is escorted to his chopper, 
he'll do his usual speech, after that Skyrider will walk towards his chopper.
If you want to avoid Skyrider to join the squad but want him as a pilot only as usual, 
go to the strategic map before Skyrider has reached his chopper. Then everything will be as in the Vanilla game.
If you want him to join, wait for him to reach his chopper, after that he will become playable.
(His 'twin brother' will be piloting the heli then, so you do not lose any functionality on recruiting Skyrider)

John will be automatically added to the player's squad after he is escorted to the airport. 
If you don't want him, you can just dismiss him.

Perko can be easily recruited, but requires user input (just click on "recruit").

Maria, automatically joins the squad after having met Angel. 
Like Skryider, there's some time between the end of the quest and her joining the squad. 
After having talked to Angel, Maria will leave the leather shop and, once standing on the road, join the player's squad. 
In that time between the end of the quest (history log beeps) and her joining, the player can go to the strategic screen if he doesn't want Maria to join the squad. 

Fred Morris as a head miner can only be recruited after the mine he leads has started to produce income for the player. 
Upon recruiting, he loses parts of his head miner function, parts might still be active and overlap.
For convenience reason, it is advised to minimize the chances that the mining income is interrupted 
(either the bug quest is already over, or sci-fi mode is unselected) in order not to cause glitches.
For testing, he can however join as soon as the mine has started to produce income.

Let the escorted persons go off on their own upon completion of their quest, they will then join if your leadership is good 



Known Bugs / personal experience:

Try to avoid using the characters Perko or TNT for interactions with NPCs, as certain actions like NPC's handing over an item (like Carmen's disk) cause the game to crash.

Don't try to use the new RPC Maria DaSilva to assist Dick for the recruitment of Babyface or you'll get an endless stop watch.

No more bugs are known, if you find them - report them!
